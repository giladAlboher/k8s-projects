Introduction
This repository contains Kubernetes manifest files for deploying WordPress and MySQL services on a Kubernetes cluster. The provided manifests define the necessary configurations to run WordPress and MySQL containers, along with a minimal Ingress resource for accessing the WordPress service.

Prerequisites
Before deploying the services using these manifest files, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

You have a running Kubernetes cluster.
kubectl is installed and properly configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
The Kubernetes cluster has an Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress) properly set up.
Deployment
Deploying MySQL
To deploy the MySQL service, apply the following Kubernetes manifests:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f mysql-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f mysql-pvc.yaml
Deploying WordPress
To deploy the WordPress service, apply the following Kubernetes manifests:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f wordpress-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f wordpress-service.yaml
Configuring Ingress
To configure Ingress and access the WordPress service, apply the Ingress manifest:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f minimal-ingress.yaml
Make sure that your Kubernetes cluster has an Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress) properly installed and set up.

Service Access
Once the deployment is successful, you can access the WordPress service using the Ingress path /testpath:

plaintext
Copy code
http://your-cluster-ip/testpath
Please replace your-cluster-ip with the IP address or domain name of your Kubernetes cluster.

Configuration
MySQL
Username: wordpress
Password: root
Database: wordpress
WordPress

Cleanup
To remove the deployed services and resources, you can use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
kubectl delete deployment wordpress
kubectl delete service wordpress-service
kubectl delete deployment mysql
kubectl delete service mysql-service
kubectl delete pvc mysql-pvc
kubectl delete ingress minimal-ingress
